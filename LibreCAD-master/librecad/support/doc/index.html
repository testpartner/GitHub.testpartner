    <p>OOPS NO MANUAL!</p>
    <p>We are very sorry butcouldnt include the manual because of License issues with the manual from the original QCad CE edition.
    However, we are working to create a new manual specially for LibreCAD.</p>
    
    <p>In the mean time, to get help on LibreCAD, please visit the following link: http://librecad.org/cms/home/get-help.html<br />
    There are some wonderfull people on the forum and IRC channel that can give you a hand to get going.</p>

    <p>We are sure you will enjoy LibreCAD as much as we do, even without a manual.</p>
    <p>
    Kind Regards,<br />
    LibreCAD Team
